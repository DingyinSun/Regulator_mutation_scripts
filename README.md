# Regulator_mutation_scripts
Assume had already run Abricate to identify the presence and absence of each regulator genes within a population.

### Step 1. Run get_locus_tag.sh
The gene names annotated by Abricate using self-made database is different to annotation by prokka and panaroo, thus it is important to make sure that the nomenclatures are consistent. 


### Step 2. Run get_annotated_name.sh




### Step 3. Run CD-HIT.sh



### Step 4. post-processing CD-HIT result
